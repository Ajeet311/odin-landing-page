# odin-landing-page
This is landing page made with html, css and flexbox.
Images and content can be inserted for any purpose.
Second project with TOP.

Personal Review:
Was a great project for practice. HTML part was easy but css and flexbox was little bit harder. Got easier after making header and getting in flow. Now I think I have good understanding of css and flexbox. Thank you!
